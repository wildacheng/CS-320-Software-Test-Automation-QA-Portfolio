## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my program is functional and secure I follow a few secure coding practices such as method parameter validation, error handling, and testing. I also implement testing to identify bug or defects before product release to ensure the quality of the software. Testing is a great way to validate the code's functionality. 


## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by holding interviews for the likely users of the product and making direct observations. From my analysis, I will create user stories to articulate a software feature from the user's perspective. From there I will create requirements to incorporate into the program.
